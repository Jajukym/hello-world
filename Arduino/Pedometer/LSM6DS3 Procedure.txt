Needed:

ESD Strap

Nitrile Gloves

Arduino R3

Arduino IDE

USB Cable

Sensor Harness



One time Arduino Setup:

Download latest Arduino IDE (1.8.5) and install from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Download software for sensor "Accelerometer_And_Gyroscope_LSM6DS3-1.0.0"

Unzip the software package and drag to C:...\Documents\Arduino\libraries

Open Arduino IDE

In the upper left of the IDE: File => Examples =>  Accelerometer_And_Gyroscope_LSM6DS3 => Pedometer and a new IDE will open

Connect the Arduino to the PC with USB cable

In the upper left of the IDE: click the arrow icon. The code will compile and upload to Arduino

Connect the harness to the Arduino

Disconnect the USB from Arduino



Setup:
Open: C:...\Documents\Arduino\Pedometer and click file in folder. The Arduino IDE will open



Procedure:

Plug the harness into HD1 of the sensor board

Plug the USB into the Arduino

In the upper right of the IDE: click the magnifying glass and a terminal will appear

Holding the board horizontal, gently lift and lower the board through the air 10 times and steps on the screen will increment.
Close terminal

Disconnect the USB from Arduino

Disconnect harness from sensor
